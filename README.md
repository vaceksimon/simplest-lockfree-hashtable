This repository contains code made in preparation for the first meeting with my potential diploma
thesis supervisor.

It is a Rust implementation of [The World's Simplest Lock-Free Hash Table](https://preshing.com/20130605/the-worlds-simplest-lock-free-hash-table/).

The used hashing function is from the [murmur3 crate](https://crates.io/crates/murmur3).

You can try running an example (generated by Gemini)
```shell
cargo run --example concurrent_usage
```
